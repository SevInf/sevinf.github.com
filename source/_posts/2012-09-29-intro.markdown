Hi everyone! This is my first blog post.
Who am I? I'm a software engineer at [BeKitzur](http://bekitzur.com/) (site under construction at the moment).
I work on various projects, mostly mobile apps. I code in Objective-C, Java, JS (browsers and node.js). I also 
make short video games occasionally, but this is more hobby than a professional activity. Here is two games which
I made in collaboration with a few great people for ludum dare 
competition:

* [Mazes In The Sky](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/minild-35/?action=preview&uid=13588);
* [Super Darwin](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=13588).

So the blog will mostly about it - mobile development, javascript, node and simple game development.
I don't expect to post frequently - I rarely have an idea for a good technical article. But hope you find
something useful here anyway.
